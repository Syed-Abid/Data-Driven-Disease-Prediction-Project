Welcome to my Data-Driven Disease Project! Dive into the exciting world of data and healthcare, where I've harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a heart disease diagnosing model. üíî‚û°Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

## About the Project

In this repository, I present my journey into the realm of predictive healthcare using data science and machine learning. My mission? To build a robust and accurate heart disease diagnosing model that can save lives.

## What's Inside?

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find in this project:

- `data/`: The heart of the project, containing the heart disease dataset.(The dataset is preset in the repository)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks where I've conducted data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- `models/`: This is where the magic happens. It houses the heart disease diagnosing model ready to predict and save lives.
- `app/`: A bonus feature! Explore a user-friendly web application to check heart disease risk.

## How it Works

1. Dive into the Jupyter notebooks to see how I've processed and analyzed the heart disease dataset.
2. Check out the heart disease diagnosing model, learn about its accuracy, and how it predicts the likelihood of heart disease.
3. Interact with the web application in the `app/` directory to experience the model in action.

## Let's Connect

I'm not just passionate about data science; I'm also dedicated to making the world a healthier place. Let's connect, collaborate, and make a difference together:
